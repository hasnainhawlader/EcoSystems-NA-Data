# Project Plan
## Title
Impact of COVID-19 on Diabetes-Related Mortality in the USA
## Main Question
1.	Did the rate of diabetes-related deaths increase in the USA after the onset of COVID-19?
## Description
Diabetes is a chronic health condition that has been a significant contributor to mortality in the USA. With the advent of COVID-19, it is important to examine how the pandemic may have exacerbated the risks associated with diabetes, potentially leading to increased mortality rates. This project analyzes mortality data before and after COVID-19 to assess any changes in diabetes-related death rates, using data from the CDC. The results can give insights into the healthcare needs of diabetic patients and guide policy for post-pandemic health planning.

Short description of the DataSource:<br/>
That dataset contains information on all-cause mortality by different causes, including diabetes, across the USA. It provides a comprehensive view of mortality rates, which can help analyze trends in diabetes-related deaths.
## Work Packages
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess both datasets to ensure consistency and handle any missing values.<br/>
Feature Combination: Extract and combine relevant features from both datasets to create a unified dataset focused on diabetes-related mortality before and after COVID-19.<br/>
Visualization: Use data visualization techniques to compare diabetes-related mortality trends before and after the pandemic, highlighting any significant differences.<br/>
